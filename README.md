This is a project for the course course: Getting and Cleaning Data. This repository contains my code run_analysis.R to perform the analysis. 

The data for the project can be found here:

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The R script does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
